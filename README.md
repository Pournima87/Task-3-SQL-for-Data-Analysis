# Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis - Internship Project

## 📌 Objective
Perform data analysis using SQL queries on an Ecommerce Demo Database. Extract insights, build views, write procedures, and demonstrate advanced SQL skills.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- MySQL 8.0
- MySQL Command Line Client

## 📁 Dataset
The database was imported using a pre-built SQL dump:
- [ecommerce_demo.sql] (imported locally using MySQL CLI)

## 📜 SQL Concepts Applied
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- SQL JOINS (INNER, LEFT)
- Subqueries & CTEs
- Aggregate Functions: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`
- Views Creation for Dashboarding
- Indexing for Query Optimization
- Stored Procedures for Dynamic Queries
- Window Functions: `RANK()`

## ✅ Key Queries
- Total quantity sold by product
- Total spending per customer
- Recent orders in the last 7 days
- Best-selling products per category (using window functions)
- Customer classification (Gold/Silver/Bronze)
- Views for dashboard integration
- A procedure to return top N spending customers

## 📎 Deliverables
- `task3_sql_analysis.sql` with all queries and logic
-  `Task3-Documentation` Screenshots of query outputs

## 💡 Outcomes
- Improved SQL query-building and optimization
- Real-world dataset handling and insights generation
- Clean, reusable, and impressive code submission for internship evaluation
